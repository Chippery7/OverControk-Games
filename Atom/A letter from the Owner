Hey, This is an Actual message from the Author/Owner of this Repository.
From this txt file I'm going to tell you a little bit about what I do with coding in my life.

First, I always loved Python (As you can see from these projects).
I love this language because of the simplicity and understandability of the language.
To me this language is just like Reading a sentence (Just a broken English one!).
I also learned Python through a book (from Barnes and Noble : ) ) called "Python For Kids", "By Jason R. Briggs".

Second, all the languages I learn now like, C, HTML, and CSS are all book read.
So I guess you could say I spend my days focusing a lot!

Last, no matter how good I think I am at coding I can't change the fact that
whatever I'm learning there's always more to it.

Goodbye now, Enjoy My projects.
